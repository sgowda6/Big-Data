CorEx
The principle of Cor-relation Ex-planation is a way to build rich representations that are informative about relationships in data, the two-thirds of the tweets collected by twint were manually segmented into topics and CorEx was then used for finding coherent meaningful topics measured across a corpus of text. 
The major dependencies of CorEx is it requires numpy and scipy, segmenting and topic modelling was done using two methods Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised learning.
Unsupervised topic modelling using CorEx is the way to generate a set of top ten  keywords for corresponding topics.
Semi-Supervised topic Modelling using CorEx uses manually generated keywords and the anchor key words topic which was generated in unsupervised learning which were mutually exclusive for every topic.
